This is the Julia code used to reproduce the simulations reported in a paper on coherence measures. It is based on Igor Douven's code for simulations of confirmation measures (https://github.com/IgorDouven/Tracking), although adapted in many ways (described in the corresponding paper).

Our simulations may be reproduced by first running coherence_simulations.jl and following the steps as documented in the file.
Then the results may be (re-)analyzed and the aggregated plots obtained by running auc_reanalyzer.jl.

Note: data from the simulations in csv files should be placed in folder "csvs" for auc_reanalyzer.jl to work. The generation of the data takes long, so we also include the (fully reproducible) data in this repository.

The plots reproduced in the paper are:

/plots/individual-simulations/auc-n6-a0_0.5confirmed_prop_autogenerated_5_trueenough_propfull.pdf

The plot mentioned in Fn. 6 is plots/aggregations/auc-all_n_and_all_a0.pdf

Note on csv data file names:

There are two types of files: those ending with "prop.csv" and "propfull.csv". The latter contain simulated data for every of 250 repetitions, while the former takes the average value of them (and is represented in the plots).

The names are structured as follows:

auc-nX-a0_YYYconfirmed_prop_autogenerated_Z-trueenough_prop(full).csv

where

X - number of pieces of information

YYY - prior probability of information

Z - how many pieces of information must be true for the set to be considered true (enough)
