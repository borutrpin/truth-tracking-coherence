This is the Julia code used to reproduce the simulations reported in a paper on coherence measures. It is based on Igor Douven's code for simulations of confirmation measures (https://github.com/IgorDouven/Tracking), although adapted in many ways (described in the corresponding paper).

Our simulations may be reproduced by first running coherence_simulations.jl and following the steps as documented in the file.
Then the results may be (re-)analyzed and the aggregated plots obtained by running auc_reanalyzer.jl.

Note: data from the simulations in csv files should be placed in folder "csvs" for auc_reanalyzer.jl to work. The generation of the data takes long, so we also include the (fully reproducible) data in this repository.

The plots reproduced in the paper are:
