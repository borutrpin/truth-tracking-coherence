This is the Julia code used to reproduce the simulations reported in a paper on coherence measures. It is based on Igor Douven's code for simulations of confirmation measures, although adapted in many ways. Igor Douven's code is available here: https://github.com/IgorDouven/Tracking

Our simulations may be reproduced by first running coherence_simulations.jl and following the steps as documented in the file.
Then the results may be re-analyzed and the aggregated plots obtained by running auc_reanalyzer.jl.
